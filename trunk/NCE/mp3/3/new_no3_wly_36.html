              <br>
              　　We are less credulous than we used to be In the nineteenth century, 
              a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his 
              readers with a series of coincidences --most of them wildly improbable. 
              Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maid-servant was 
              really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was presumed 
              dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring 
              about the hero's down- fall. And so on. Modern readers would find 
              such naive solutions totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances 
              do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but 
              a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.<br>
              　　When I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi-driver, 
              Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed 
              twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped 
              to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman commented 
              on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested 
              that he might be his brother. Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing 
              out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though 
              Mrs. Bussman was fully acquainted with this story, she thought that 
              there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days 
              later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was 
              Hans Bussman, Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and 
              he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were 
              re-united, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After 
              having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent 
              to hospital and was separated from his unit. The hospital had been 
              bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. 
              Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. 
              Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed 
              and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. 
              Assuming that his family had been killed during an air-raid, Hans 
              settled down in a Village fifty miles away where he had remained 
              ever since.</p>
